Duck-Bugging is a fun, interactive website inspired by the concept of **rubber duck debugging** — the idea that explaining your code to a rubber duck can help you find and solve bugs.  

This project was built to experiment with **3D web graphics** and front-end development.

## Features

- **Download Recordings:** Record yourself debugging your code by clicking on the Duck. You can download the files or just listen on your browser.
- **3D Models of a Duck:** A custom-made duck model created in **Blender** and rendered using **Three.js**. By using Three.js, the Duck has 2 different animations to look at for your enjoyment.
- **Fun Debugging:** Inspired by rubber duck debugging, giving programmers a playful way to debug their code.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js** – for 3D model rendering  
- **Blender** – to create the 3D duck model  
- **GIMP** – for designing the website logo  
- **Vite** – for fast development and bundling  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – core front-end technologies

## Learning

This website was used to learn Three.js and create a fun concept for a website. I learnt how to use Three.js to render 3D images on a website, animate and more, i also learnt how to use Blender to create 3D models.
This project was made to further my learning of JavaScript and HTML. It was a fun excercise and experimenting with fun programming concepts.
